##Machine Learning Model
I used Scikit Random forest classifier, though in the future I would want to move to tensorflow.
I also could not find any dataset of frog noises, so I made my own in the program, but I need to upload many more frog noises and train. I also used Cursor ai for help in generating some code to train.
